This is an android app that allows you to order sodas from the internet-enabled soda machine
owned and maintained by the S&T ACM chapter. It's kinda...err...really ugly now, and doesn't work.

Contributing: Email me before you just push stuff to the repo. nmjxv3@mst.edu

License: I think this'll be GPL, but not sure yet. 

Todo:
Prettification
Do REST calls
Persist username/passowrd? between runs
General error checkng might not be bad either
